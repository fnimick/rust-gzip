rust-gzip: Rust library exporting a C interface for gzip decompression
--------
Cargo.lock - autogenerated dependency information for Cargo
Cargo.toml - Cargo package information
src/lib.rs - exported C bindings, library entry point
src/macros.rs - convenience macros used everywhere else
src/gz.rs - manages gzip decompression using safe Rust constructs
src/cvec.rs - analog to Vec that can be converted to or created from 
     a C pointer and freed by the calling C application
src/header.rs - reads the gzip file header (not the block header)
src/gz_reader.rs - wraps a CVec to support reading bit by bit
src/huffman.rs - huffman tree structures, and code to create them from
     ranges as defined in the gzip specification
src/inflate.rs - gzip tree building and decompression
src/crc32.rs - CRC32 implementation, to check correctness
src/rgzip.rs - C header matching signature exported by lib.rs, to be
     included in C applications using our library
